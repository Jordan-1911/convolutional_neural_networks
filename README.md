<h1>This repository covers convolutional neural networks in Python</h1>

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that are widely used for image and video classification, object detection, and natural language processing. In this repository, we will be exploring the fundamentals of CNNs in Python.</p>

<p>We will cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building and training CNN models using popular deep learning libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow</li>
  <li>Implementing and understanding key concepts such as convolution layers, pooling layers, and activation functions</li>
  <li>Preprocessing and transforming image data for use in CNNs</li>
  <li>Fine-tuning and transferring learning to improve model performance</li>
</ul>
